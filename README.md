CareCrew – Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a complete exploratory and modeling workflow built around the CareCrew dataset. The project focuses on understanding the data, identifying meaningful patterns, preparing the features, and building machine learning models to extract insights and make predictions.
All of the work is developed inside the two main notebooks in this folder, and the dataset details are documented separately for clarity.
Project Contents
1. CARE_CREW (3).ipynb
This notebook walks through the initial exploration of the dataset. It includes:
Loading and understanding the raw data
Checking missing values and inconsistencies
Basic cleaning steps
Summary statistics
Initial visualizations to understand trends and relationships
The goal of this notebook is to get familiar with the structure of the data and highlight early observations.
2. Project_CareCrew (1).ipynb
This notebook continues the workflow with deeper analysis and model building. It includes:
Additional data preprocessing
Feature engineering
Splitting the dataset for training and testing
Training machine learning models
Comparing model performance
Noting the important features and insights from the model outputs
This notebook represents the main analytical and predictive work of the project.
3. Dataset.md
This file explains the dataset used in the project, including:
Variable descriptions
Data format
How to interpret each column
Notes about the dataset source or context
This serves as a reference when navigating the notebooks.
